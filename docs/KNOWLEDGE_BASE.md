## Troubleshooting

### My Fish Won't Eat the Food
**Category:** Troubleshooting  
**Tags:** feeding, food, collision, bug

If food drops but your fish doesn't eat it:

**Possible causes:**
1. **Food reached the bottom** - Food that falls to the bottom stays there until you clean
2. **Fish is moving away** - The fish might be swimming in a different area
3. **Collision detection** - The fish needs to be close to the food (within about 20% of tank size)

**Solutions:**
1. **Wait for the food to fall** - It takes about 6 seconds
2. **Feed again** - Drop more food; the fish will swim toward it
3. **Clean the tank** - This removes uneaten food at the bottom
4. **Check fish position** - The fish moves automatically toward food

**If the problem persists:**
- Restart the app
- Make sure you're tapping the Feed button correctly
- Check that the hunger stat is updating

---

### My Stats Aren't Updating
**Category:** Troubleshooting  
**Tags:** stats, bug, not updating

If your fish's stats don't seem to be updating:

**Check these things:**
1. **Wait a moment** - Stats update after actions complete
2. **Check the stat bars** - Look at the visual bars, not just numbers
3. **Feed/clean again** - Make sure the action completed successfully

**Common issues:**
- **Food didn't reach fish** - Clean the tank and try feeding again
- **Action didn't trigger** - Make sure you tapped the button correctly
- **App needs refresh** - Close and reopen the app

- Force close the app and reopen
- Check that you have the latest version
- Contact support if the problem continues
